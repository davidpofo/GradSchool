# finalproject798W
My final project for the course R Programming for the Behavioral Sciences that I took during the winter term at the University of Maryland. 
I was tasked with:
1. Picking some data to work with
2. Perform some kind of analysis, which may result in one or
more of:
(a) Numerical results
(b) A complex object (like a regression analysis)
(c) Graphical results (like a plot)
3. Report the analysis with appropriate documentation
4. Some aspect of the above (data/analysis/reporting) needs to be
“non-trivial,” i.e., something we have not explicitly covered in
class
5. Post results and replicable code via GitHub (preferred), or email a complete zipped repository to me.
